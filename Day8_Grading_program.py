# Grading Program
# You have access to a database of student_scores in the format of a dictionary. 
# The keys in student_scores are the names of the students and the values are their exam scores. 
# Write a program that converts their scores to grades.
# By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades 
# that should contain student names as keys and their assessed grades for values. 
# The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked. 
# **DO NOT** modify lines 1-7 to change the existing student_scores dictionary. 
# This is the scoring criteria: 
# - Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding" 
# - Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations" 
# - Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable" 
# - Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"
